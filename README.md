WorkOut app beta is currently deployed at https://workout-beta.herokuapp.com

Its a Real Time Workout platform for running with your friends which renders your calories burnt, current location map, route map until now, distance travelled and shows it against your connection anywhere in the world and they can look at your stats.

Stack used is React.js, Google Firebase real time database and authentication, Node.js.

Facebook Auth works in development but needs permissions in production mode in Heroku which is bing resolved but regular login works. 

Please enable your brouser to share your location and give it a second to start taking the user coordinates.
